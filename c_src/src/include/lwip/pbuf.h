 * pbuf needs to be copied in order to be kept around beyond the current call
 * stack without risking being corrupted. The default setting provides safety:
 * it will make a copy iof any pbuf chain that does not consist entirely of
 * PBUF_ROM type pbufs. For setups with zero-copy support, it may be redefined
 * to evaluate to true in all cases, for example. However, doing so also has an
 * effect on the application side: any buffers that are *not* copied must also
 * *not* be reused by the application after passing them to lwIP. For example,
 * when setting PBUF_NEEDS_COPY to (0), after using udp_send() with a PBUF_RAM
 * pbuf, the application must free the pbuf immediately, rather than reusing it
 * for other purposes. For more background information on this, see tasks #6735
